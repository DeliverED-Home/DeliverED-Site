                <p>Your DeliverED Home mailbox is made up of two sections – the delivery and secure sections. The delivery section is the top door of the device where packages can be placed inside to be delivered. This section can be locked by your
                  app
                  to prevent deliveries if you’re not expecting any. The secure section is where your packages are stored, accessed via the bottom door. This door is always locked, unless opened via the DeliverED app or emergency manual key. Inside
                  you’ll find your packages neatly piled up on top of a lift mechanism that is used during the delivery process. How to perform actions using the app are detailed under the <a href="#item-2-3">Software Operation</a>.</p>

            <strong>Particle Photon Microcontroller:</strong> (See Figure 1) The brains of the device, this tiny IoT device communicates with
            the cloud to allow you to talk to your mailbox from the DeliverED app. It is fixed below the lift, and you will find many
            internal wires connected to it. <br><br>
            <strong>Collapsible Floor:</strong> (See Figure 5) The floor of the delivery section works as a trapdoor, consisting of some rotating shafts and a spring mechanism. When released, a package falls through to the secure section. <br><br>
            <strong>Lift Mechanism:</strong> (See Figure 4) The moving platform is attached to the back of the device, where a Lego EV3
            motor powers several shafts which rotate to move two tank-style tracks up and down. The platform is attached to these,
            moving with them. <br><br>
            <strong>Solenoid:</strong> (See Figure 2) There are two of these in the system, one for each door. They function as the locks on
            the device, controlled electronically to either pull in or push out a small metal rod which controls the state of the doors. <br><br>
            <strong>Infrared Sensor:</strong> (See Figure 4) These are used to detect when a package is in the way, allowing for internal calculations of when to stop the platform from rising any further. <br><br>
            <strong>Yale key mechanism:</strong> (See Figure 3) This functions as the emergency manual unlock for the secure section. When the
            correct key is inserted, the door is unlocked. This overrides any signal being given to the solenoid and is primarily used
            if the system has run out of power. <br><br>
            <strong>8-Way AA Power Supply:</strong> (See Figure 6) The is what powers the the Particle Photon and all the components of
            the mailbox - the infrared sensors, the solenoid lock, the forklift and the collapsible door. <br><br>
            <strong>Delivery button:</strong> This is visible on the outside of the device and is a simple button that when pressed sends a signal
            to the Photon. This triggers a function within the device that begins the delivery sequence so long as it also detects that
            the delivery door is locked.

            <h4>Installation and Operation</h4>
            <h6>Installation</h6>
            <p>When your DeliverED Home mailbox arrives, it is highly recommended that you call one of our expert handyperson to install it for you. For a small fee, this will handle everything from getting your device securely attached to a wall or
              the ground to prevent theft as well as setting up the internal micro-controller to connect to your home Wi-Fi. If you would rather perform the installation yourself however, full instructions on everything required to get your device up
              and running are detailed below. These are the same instructions our handymen will follow when setting up your device for you.
              <br><br>
              <i>You will need:</i>
              <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>DIY tools (A drill, bolts to secure the device, etc.)</li>
              <li>An Android mobile phone (running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Lollipop">Android 5 (Lollipop)</a>+)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Physical Installation</strong>
              <br>
              The DeliverED Home mailbox is heavy, but to prevent a would-be thief from simply taking the whole device, we highly recommend the first step to be securely bolting it into either a wall or the ground. Ensure that your chosen bolting
              method is secure and does not interfere with the internal workings of the device such as the lift. You will then need to turn on the internal power supply, which can be done at the flick of an internal switch.

              <strong>Step 2: Micro-Controller Setup</strong>
              <br>
              Inside your mailbox, you will find a small area beneath the lift which contains the key electronics of the device, including a Particle Photon, a small microcontroller that works as the brains of the device. For this step you will need
              to download the Particle app and sign into it. Once you are logged in, press the small SETUP button on the microcontroller until the light begins to blink blue. Then, tap the ‘+’ button on the Particle app and go through Wi-Fi setup.
              This should add the credentials of your home Wi-Fi to the device, allowing it to function.

            <p><strong>Deliver a package</strong>
              <br>
              When a mailperson arrives to deliver a package, the process is simple. First, they will open the upper door and place the
              package inside the delivery section. Next, the door is then closed again and once done they may can press the ‘deliver’
              button on the front of the device. This is all the input required to deliver a package, unless the mailbox is full or otherwise
              locked. <br><br>
              Internally, the delivery process is as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Deliver button is pressed and delivery door locked.</li>
              <li>Internal lift is raised to its maximum height, taking into account existing packages. This height is detected via an infrared sensor on the inside.</li>
              <li>Trapdoor is unlocked, dropping the package a very short distance onto the lift platform.</li>
              <li>Internal lift is lowered all the way down.</li>
              <li>Trapdoor is closed, and the delivery door unlocked.</li>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use our services, and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you. DeliverEd does not share
          your information with any third parties, and any information we do collect will only be used as permitted by law.We use your personal data to provide our personalised secure mailbox services. By using our services, you agree to the
          collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please read this Policy and ensure that you understand it.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h4>
        <h5>Types of Data Colected</h5>
        <h6>Personal Data</h6>
        <p>While using our app services, we will ask you to sign in using your Google account. This provides us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. This is also our only point of collecting
          information. This information consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email address</li>
          <li>First and last name</li>
          <li>Usage data</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Usage Data</h6>
        <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using our services.
        <p>
        <p>Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our site or app that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those
          pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Use of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <p>DeliverEd may use personal data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To provide our service,</strong> as we rely on information provided by Google to identify you.</li>
          <li><strong>To manage your account:</strong> to manage your registration as a user of the service. This involves registering devices under your name, and adding people to your existing devices.</li>
          <li><strong>To contact you;</strong> to contact you by email, or other equivalent forms of electronic communication, such as a mobile application's push notifications regarding updates or informative communications related to the
            functionalities, products, or contracted services, including the security updates, when necessary or reasonable for their implementation.</li>
          <li><strong>To manage your requests:</strong> to attend and manage your requests and queries to us.</li>
          <li><strong>For other purposes:</strong> we may use your information for other purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our service,
            products, services, marketing, and your experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Retention of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <p>DeliverEd will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use this data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we
          are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter
          time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods. You can request a report of the information we retain on
          you by contacting us using one of the methods detailed at the end of this document. You can also contact us to opt out of data collection, however this will prevent you from using our services, as our mailboxes rely on personal profiles to
          function.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Transfer of Your Persoanl Data</h5>
        <p>DeliverEd does not process your personal data in external offices, and relies solely on data shared with us by Google. Because of this, there will be no transference of your personal data by us.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <h6>Business Transactions</h6>
        <p>If DeliverEd is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your personal data may be transferred. We will provide notice before this occurs.</p>
        <h6>Law Enforcement</h6>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Security of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <p>The security of your personal data is extremely important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
          protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Our collection of data largely relies on the security of data stored by Google.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
        <p>Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
          with personal data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
        <p>Our service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
          review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our app and website, prior to the change
          becoming effective and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this
          page.</p>
