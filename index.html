        <h6>System Summary</h6>
        <p>All functionalities of our mailboxes are managed within either the physical device, or by our app. The human interaction process for a package delivery via our devices is as follows. First, the courier opens the delivery compartment,
          places a package inside, and pushes a clearly labelled “Deliver” button on the top of the device. The package is then dropped into a secure compartment. Internally, the delivery process is as follows:</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-10">
            <ol>
              <li>Deliver button is pushed and delivery door locked.</li>
              <li>Internal lift is raised to its maximum height, taking into account existing packages. This height is detected via an infrared sensor on the inside.</li>
              <li>Trapdoor is unlocked, dropping the package a very short distance onto the lift platform.</li>
              <li>Internal lift is lowered all the way down.</li>
              <li>Trapdoor is closed, and the delivery door unlocks.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

        </div>
        <div class="space"></div>
        <h6>Inside the Mailbox</h6>
        <p>The DeliverED Home mailbox is made up of two sections – the delivery compartment and the secure compartment. The delivery section is the top door of the device where packages can be placed inside by couriers. This section can be locked by
          the app to prevent deliveries if you’re not expecting any, and when the mailbox is full. The secure section is where your packages are stored, accessible via the bottom door. This door is always locked, unless opened via the DeliverED app
          or emergency manual key. Inside you will find your packages neatly piled up on top of a lift mechanism that is used during the delivery process. How to perform actions using the app is detailed under <a class="u u-C blue-link"
            href="#the-app">The App</a>.

        <strong>Particle Photon Microcontroller:</strong> (See Figure 1) The brains of the device, this tiny IoT device communicates with
        the cloud to allow you to talk to your mailbox from the DeliverED app. It is fixed below the lift, and you will find many
        internal wires connected to it. <br><br>
        <strong>Collapsible Floor:</strong> (See Figure 5) The floor of the delivery section works as a trapdoor, consisting of some rotating shafts and a spring mechanism. When released, a package falls through to the secure section. <br><br>
        <strong>Lift Mechanism:</strong> (See Figure 4) The moving platform is attached to the back of the device, where a Lego EV3
        motor powers several shafts which rotate to move two tank-style tracks up and down. The platform is attached to these,
        moving with them. <br><br>
        <strong>Solenoid:</strong> (See Figure 2) There are two of these in the system, one for each door. They function as the locks on
        the device, controlled electronically to either pull in or push out a small metal rod which controls the state of the doors. <br><br>
        <strong>Infrared Sensor:</strong> (See Figure 4) These are used to detect when a package is in the way, allowing for internal calculations of when to stop the platform from rising any further. <br><br>
        <strong>Yale key mechanism:</strong> (See Figure 3) This functions as the emergency manual unlock for the secure section. When the
        correct key is inserted, the door is unlocked. This overrides any signal being given to the solenoid and is primarily used
        if the system has run out of power. <br><br>
        <div id="the-app"></div>
        <strong>8-Way AA Power Supply:</strong> (See Figure 6) This is what powers the the Particle Photon and all the components of
        the mailbox - the infrared sensors, the solenoid lock, the forklift and the collapsible door. <br><br>
        <strong>Delivery button:</strong> This is visible on the outside of the device and is a simple button that when pressed sends a signal
        to the Photon. This triggers a function within the device that begins the delivery sequence so long as it also detects that
        the delivery door is locked.

        <h6>The App</h6>
        <p>
          Since our users will control and use our mailboxes entirely through our app, we have taken care to make our User Interface as accessible and usable as possible, to ensure that our device is optimised for use by everyone. We have taken care
          to make everyday actions like unlocking and locking your mailbox as easy as possible, with little to no app navigation necessary. Our blue and green colour scheme gives our users a sense of security, which is extremely important when
          trusting an automated machine to handle personal parcels. <br>
          <br>Our app communicates directly with our mailboxes via a particle photon. Each mailbox has its own photon, with a unique ID used to identify and register your device. This connection facilitates all sensors and actions carried out by the
          physical device. Photons communicate via the cloud, so there is no need for us to be storing any personal data of our users, which we believe is a huge selling point for our devices. <br>
          The major use cases of our app are detailed below:

        </blockquote>
        Upon successfully logging in you will be brought to the Device Manager/Home Screen. This is where you can view all the devices (mailboxes) you have connected to your account. If you have just created your account, you
        will see no devices here yet!
        <br><br>
        <i><strong>Logging Out / Switching Account <span style="color:red">(See item 3)</span></strong></i>
        <br>
        If you wish to log out of the app, or switch accounts, navigate to your Profileby tapping the avatar (right-most) icon on the navigation bar located at the bottom of your screen. Then tap ‘Log out’ and confirm your action! You will be
        brought back to the login screen.

            <h6>The Walls</h6>
            <p>
              For the walls of the mailbox, we can use
              stainless steel<sup><a class="u u-C blue-link"
                  href="https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/metal-sheets/0559111/?cm_mmc=UK-PLA-DS3A-_-google-_-PLA_UK_EN_Engineering_Materials_%26_Industrial_Hardware_Whoop-_-Stainless%20Steel%20Sheets_Whoop-_-559111&gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rNEwPtiD05Ts7fbEI-cH-itfk6fUxlKepf4HNEEZbpT5zayMJCZo2RoCnhkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&matchtype=&pla-302964212382">1</a></sup>.
              This will prove to be both sturdy and
              weather resistant. It is corrosion and erosion resistant,
              and it will not be easy to cut through. We can also
              paint it, giving customers an option to customise their
              mailbox. The price
              related to this can be ascertained after meeting with
              our potential production partners.
            </p>
            <h6>Movable Platform</h6>
            <p>We can build the movable platform using stainless steel as well. We will probably
              have to use more powerful motors as compared to
              the ones we are using in the workshop. The price related to this can be ascertained after meeting with our
              potential production partners.
            </p>
            <h6>Handyperson for installation</h6>
            <p>
              We suggest 2 people for
              2 hours for installing the smart mailbox according to
              the customers’ preference. The average hourly rate of
              a handyman is £11.71<sup><a class="u u-C blue-link" href="https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Handyman/Hourly_Rate.">2</a></sup>. So the total installation fee
              will be £46.84.
            </p>
            <h6>UV Sterilizer LED</h6>
            <p>We expect there to be 2 such
              LEDs (110 V, US) on 2 opposite walls (the ones adjacent to the access doors). The total comes to £24.02
              (£12.01 each)<sup><a class="u u-C blue-link"
                  href="https://uk.banggood.com/50W-UV-LED-Ultraviolet-Sterilizer-Lamp-Germicidal-Disinfection-Mite-Removal-p-1685241.html?utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=cpc_organic&gmcCountry=GB&utm_content=minha&utm_campaign=minha-gbg-en-pc&currency=GBP&cur_warehouse=CN&createTmp=1&utm_source=googleshopping&utm_medium=cpc_bgs&utm_content=sxxx&utm_campaign=sxxx-ssc-gbg-all-newcustom-ncv80-0928&ad_id=468370263002&gclid=CjwKCAiAgc-ABhA7EiwAjev-j24qHFNyqYHWovR-0uR6sUqkLh0BnBq5BSeRZAGhFRHUdECgRBSD2BoCOLMQAvD_BwE&ID=566615">3</a>.
            </p>
            <h6>Locks</h6>
            <p>All materials for the lock are expected to remain the same, although upon a future round of testing
              (hypothetically) if we find that the locks are not sturdy
              enough to withstand brute force, we might have to
              look at certain improvements, although the core mechanisms stay the same. The cost for building the current
              electromagnetic locks have been included in the budget.
            </p>
            <h6>Bascule trap door / collapsible platform</h6>
            <p>This platform separates the drop-off area and the secure compartment. We can use RSPro struts, which are £41 per
              metre and angle joints for RSPro struts, which are £5
              each<sup><a class="u u-C blue-link" href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/sdp/SDP2020/sdppricelist.pdf">4</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <h6>Particle Photon</h6>
            <p>
              The IoT computer responsible for taking commands from our app and controlling the mailbox.
            </p>
            <h6>Power Supply</h6>
            <p>
              As apposed to the 8-way AA power supply we're currently using in our prototype, we would use a LIPO Battery 11.1V 1800mAh LB-012<sup><a class="u u-C blue-link"
                  href="https://www.robotis.us/lipo-battery-11-1v-1800mah-lb-012/">5</a></sup>.
              This would provide us with the long battery life we desired.

            <p>Over the course of development, changes were made to our original vision of the project which significantly impacted our budget. Some of the smaller changes included adding extra sensors, such as infrared, which was a decision made
              after the initial planning process. The updated budget also takes technical time into account, which was something we were unsure of our ability to use at the stage of Demo 1, as we were considering using solely Webots simulation and no
              physical hardware.
            </p>
            <p>A more significant design change was going from our initial idea of a scissor lift to a forklift, to handle the inner platform of the mailbox. One of the huge deciding factors of this, other than the obvious hardware limitations, was
              the fact that even folded down all the way, the scissor lift would take up a significant portion of the height of the mailbox, reducing its ability to hold parcels. The forklift on the other hand is simply a moving platform, and takes
              up significantly less room. It is also a lot easier to use infrared sensors with a forklift, as there is only one moving component, and no supporting scaffolding.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the potential security risks involved with our product came to our attention later in development, which led us to rethink our door locking mechanisms. Our initial plan was a magnetic lock, which is something we have stuck
              with, but we have now taken care to include a heavy-duty deadbolt lock as well, which would act in the event of power failure. This is to prevent an unpowered mailbox being left unlocked and at risk.</p>

              As you can see from the Gantt charts in this section, there were some time alterations necessary for our initial plan. In the first demo, we had initially planned to design the website UI, and start designing sections of the app UI. We
              ended up with a fully designed and partially implemented app UI, as well as a rough design of our website. In terms of our Webots simulation, we had a basic model, which is what we had planned.<br><br>
              In demo 2, since we were already ahead in terms of our app, we were able to get a fully functioning app front-end, and start testing out the UI. We had initially only planned to have some basic functionalities like navigation at this
              stage, so this was a huge success by the group. In our initial plan, there was no real mention of commissioning hardware, as we didn’t know if that was something we could do. We ended up commissioning our magnetic lock in this demo, and
              deciding against using a camera on the front of our device for security reasons. In terms of Webots, we had a simulation showing our device mainframe, which was what we had planned.

              The third demo was more about hardware, and getting our app to communicate with our various components. In our initial plan we mentioned WiFi/Bluetooth module installation, and this ended up coming about in the form of the particle
              photon, which we installed in this demo. We also commissioned our forklift, and performed testing on the components we had at this stage. We started looking at app-device connectivity, and managed to get a button on our app to turn a
              LED on a particle photon on/off. This showed real-world interaction which we planned to develop in demo 4. We updated our Webots simulation to include infrared sensors, and updated our website according to plan. There were also
              revisions to our app UI in response to accessibility and usability workshops, which we could not have foreseen in our initial planning stages. We also created an advertisement video, which we were not initially planning to do.<br><br>
              The final demo was about getting everything ready to present. We completed our app, website and Webots simulation as planned, but with some minor deviations. We spent time completing QR code scanning for our app, stress testing both our
              app and simulation, and updating our app UI for further usability changes. These were things we thought to do later in the process, which is why they were not in the initial plan. We also completed our robot-app communication
              implementation and testing, and performed extensive tests on the hardware components we had commissioned.

              We tested the open/closed state of our solenoid by both
              operating it with our microcontroller and manipulating it
              manually, then checking the sensor readings for whether
              they reflect it being pulled in or pushed out. On average,
              the readings were accurate 4/5 times. We suspect that the
              sensor readings are not entirely accurate due to some noise
              present in them. We ran a similar test after manipulating our
              latch and the latch sensor returned expected values between
              3/5 and 4/5 times, with some noise accounting for 1 or 2
              unexpected readings. For each case, we changed states (i.e.,
              between 0 and 1) 5 times[1]. When returning the state of
              the above components to the app, we look at readings in
              groups of 5. If 3 or more readings are the same, we report
              the state that corresponds to the majority reading.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our remote technition was present at the lab to confirm that our solenoid
              was working as expected at all points, which means that it
              was pulled in at our "on" command and pushed out at our
              "off" command (as was implemented using the microcontroller).
            </p>
            <p>
              We also tested our secure compartment mechanisms which
              included a forklift driven by a motor and two infrared sensors. One sensor (s1) is at the top of the compartment (at
              33 cm), pointing across it and mounted onto a wall adjacent
              to the doors. The other sensor (s2) is at the bottom of the
              compartment, pointing upwards. If s1 returns less than 19
              cm (width of the compartment),then we know a parcel has
              entered the secure compartment. Readings from s2 let us
              know the distance of the moving platform from the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ran 30 iterations of the movable platform’s upward and
              downward movement to decide on thresholds of when it
              should stop. The forklift is about 48 cm high. To allow for
              the parcel some space to enter the secure compartment and
              drop into the platform, we stop it at 31-32 cm when going
              up. We want to stop the platform at a 4-5 cm distance from
              the floor to avoid it ramming into the sensor s2 when going
              down.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ran 5 iterations of dropping a single parcel into the
              movable platform. It stopped after moving down far enough
              to clear s1’s ’line of vision’ 100% of the time. We ran
              another 5 iterations with multiple boxes (3), placed one after
              the other. The forklift moved down as expected 100% of
              the time. Upon placing a parcel such that s1 returned a
              reading of less than 19 cm while the moving platform was
              at 4 cm from the ground, it did not move down any further,
              which is the desired behaviour. In this state, we are able to
              raise a flag of "Mailbox is full".
            </p>
            <p>
              We also had to allow for a little noise in our infrared sensors.
              Sensor s1 gives a reading which sometimes varies between 19 and 20 cm while there is no parcel. We take the lower
              threshold, i.e., 19 cm, to check against. This worked well
              for our above test cases. Sensor s2 gives a similar varying
              reading, which is why we allowed a 1 cm interval when
              deciding the thresholds as discussed previously.

              We ran multiple test for the Webots
              simulation in order to ensure its robustness and investigate
              its capacity. Even though its simulation testing, in order
              to present a real-life scenario, the parcel size and process
              are strictly following the maximum standard of <a class="u u-C blue-link" href="https://business.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/89/~/size-and-weight-guide-%E2%80%93-uk-letters-and-parcels">Royal Mail
                UK Parcels Size and Weight</a>. The length of UV sanitation
              differs based on parcel size after research <a class="u u-C blue-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344204496_Effectiveness_of_222-nm_ultraviolet_light_on_disinfecting_SARS-CoV-2_surface_contamination">(Hiroki

              From the experiments we could tell that for the current
              size of the mailbox (75cm*75cm*100cm), it could take 12
              max-size letters, or 5 max-size small parcels, or 1 max-size medium parcel. Blueprints and actual simulations
              are provided as screenshots. Though the large size parcel
              cannot be put into our mailbox, according to Royal Mail
              standard, large parcel has a length of 1.5 meters, such
              large parcels (e.g. television, furniture, etc.) are better to be
              handled in person, which is not considered as our product
              initiative.

            <p>
              We
              used <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkey" class="blue-link u u-C">Monkey</a> to test the robustness and stability of our Android
              application. Memory usage and coherence between different classes was considered. The table on the right contains testing of all the
              functionalities of the application and their testing results.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the test, we found that some functions are highly dependent on the quality of the network. When the network delay
              is high or the connection is unstable, the functions trying
              to send HTTP Post will be blocked. At the beginning of
              the design, if the function corresponding to a button cannot
              be finished due to network reasons, it will cause the button
              to be temporarily inaccessible. This is to prevent excessive
              touches from causing the entire application to become unresponsive. In specific use, although the user cannot touch
              the functions that are being used, he can touch functions
              that have not yet been used, such as the navigation bar.
              The results of the stress test show that the application performs well when it does not involve frequent page switching, but if frequent page switching is performed, some
              functions will occupy a considerable amount of memory.
              This is because the App uses a polling method to update the
              data, and the data on the entire page will re-send the HTTP
              command to Particle Photon every time it is re-entered.
              When the data is obtained, the page will not be refreshed
              immediately, but will be automatically refreshed after the
              user leaves the page or the page is static for a period of time.
              Before entering the new interface, the application will also
              try to obtain updated data.

              For our usability testing, we had 5 participants, 2 of whom
              were native English speakers while 3 were non-native English speakers. While 3 of them were from within the
              Systems Design Project course, 2 of them were from outside of the School of Informatics. All of them were students
              at the University of Edinburgh. Maintaining a balanced mix
              of both native and non-native English speakers as well as
              students with and without a technical background helped us
              shed some light onto how different people would interact
              with our app.
            </p>
            <p>
              The testing was conducted as
              a recorded video call with each of the participants, where
              they were given access to our app’s user interface through a
              rendering on <a class="u u-C blue-link" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/8aGzkBc5NH4CKAhbOSKRtx/DHome-Usability-Testing?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a>. We described our project to them
              and how the app ties with the hardware. They were then
              asked to perform certain tasks using the app and rate how
              difficult it was for them to complete the tasks. We also noted
              some useful comments while analysing the participant’s
              interaction with our app. At the end we asked them some
              general questions and documented their feedback.
            </p>
            <p>The tasks were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Login and view your account</li>
              <li>Determine the status of Jane’s mailbox delivery door, battery life and storage capacity</li>
              <li>Add a new device via the QR code on the mailbox</li>
              <li>Unlock and lock your new device</li>
              <li>Edit your device name and remove Jane from the device then save those settings</li>
              <li>Remove your device</li>
              <li>View all your notifications, then just John's mailbox notifications</li>

        <h4>myRenzBox</h4>
        <p>It is targeted at commercial and residential buildings where it needs to be provided for the
          tenants and dwellers, by the owners. DeliverEd Home,
          on the other hand, targets a slightly different demographic and has been designed keeping home owners
          in mind, which means that it is perfectly suitable for
          individual purchase and personal use. This also means
          that our design is much more compact as compared to
          myRenzBox and can be installed into smaller spaces.
          The sanitation feature of our product is another differentiating factor, which is not included in myRenzbox.
          As discussed under "Market Requirement", there is a
          constant public health concern at the moment and our
          UV sanitisation feature will help customers to protect
          themselves and their family from contamination.</p>

        <h4>Yale Smart Delivery Box</h4>
        <p>A key difference between our products is that there is no secure compartment in their design. The parcel drop-off and collection area are the same. This makes already dropped off
          parcels susceptible to theft by delivery people with illintentions. This was a key consideration in our design
          for DeliverEd Home, where we have a secure compartment for parcel storage, which is not accessible from
          the drop-off compartment, other than parcels being
          dropped down. This means that the customer’s parcels
          will not be accessible to anyone other than them or
          their trusted ones. The Yale box is unlocked using
          a keypad attached to it, which is an optional feature.
          This brings in the hassle of creating, remembering and
          sharing a pass-code so that people can retrieve parcels
          from the mailbox. In contrast, DeliverEd Home can
          be unlocked remotely, using our app, while having a
          backup lock and key mechanism. This means that you
          can give your trusted ones access to your parcels in
          the secure compartment without having to be share a
          pass-code. This is useful in situations such as when
          you may have perishables delivered that you can’t collect in time. The Yale box remains unlocked until a
          delivery is made and then auto-locks. The problem
          here would be that anyone can drop off anything. On
          the other hand, the drop off area for DeliverEd Home
          is secured using an electromagnetic lock which we
          plan on operating using our app. You can keep it open
          for the duration that you expect a delivery. Securing it was considered so that no random person can
          pull a prank and drop off unexpected items into your
          mailbox. Yale’s design also does not consider accessibility issues. For example, in most cases, one would
          have to bend down to retrieve parcels from it. DeliverEd Home takes this into consideration and allows
          you to customise its installation to a preferred height.
          The sanitation option is, again, a differentiating factor between our product and Yale’s, where they don’t
          provide one, unlike us.</p>

        <h4>Amazon Locker</h4>
        <p>This is a “go and collect”
          service which may or may not be available in an area
          close to you, whereas with DeliverEd Home, you are
          able to store your parcels at your own address. So,
          you don’t have to worry about the inconvenience of
          having to travel to collect your parcels. With Amazon
          Lockers, you have 3 calendar days to pick up your
          parcels, but with DeliverEd Home, you don’t have to
          worry about how long you are away. You can store
          your parcels in our mailbox for as long as you need
          to. Another important consideration is that only items
          dispatched by Amazon are eligible for delivery to and
          collection from a Locker. With DeliverEd Home you
          can opt for any courier service of your choice. And
          lastly, just as with the above two, you have an option
          to sanitise your parcels inside our mailbox, which you

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use our services, and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you. DeliverEd does not share
          your information with any third parties, and any information we do collect will only be used as permitted by law.We use your personal data to provide our personalised secure mailbox services. By using our services, you agree to the
          collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please read this Policy and ensure that you understand it.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h4>
        <h5>Types of Data Colected</h5>
        <h6>Personal Data</h6>
        <p>While using our app services, we will ask you to sign in using your Google account. This provides us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. This is also our only point of collecting
          information. This information consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email address</li>
          <li>First and last name</li>
          <li>Usage data</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Usage Data</h6>
        <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using our services.
        <p>
        <p>Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our site or app that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those
          pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Use of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <p>DeliverEd may use personal data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To provide our service,</strong> as we rely on information provided by Google to identify you.</li>
          <li><strong>To manage your account:</strong> to manage your registration as a user of the service. This involves registering devices under your name, and adding people to your existing devices.</li>
          <li><strong>To contact you;</strong> to contact you by email, or other equivalent forms of electronic communication, such as a mobile application's push notifications regarding updates or informative communications related to the
            functionalities, products, or contracted services, including the security updates, when necessary or reasonable for their implementation.</li>
          <li><strong>To manage your requests:</strong> to attend and manage your requests and queries to us.</li>
          <li><strong>For other purposes:</strong> we may use your information for other purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our service,
            products, services, marketing, and your experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Retention of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <p>DeliverEd will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use this data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we
          are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter
          time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods. You can request a report of the information we retain on
          you by contacting us using one of the methods detailed at the end of this document. You can also contact us to opt out of data collection, however this will prevent you from using our services, as our mailboxes rely on personal profiles to
          function.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <p>DeliverEd does not process your personal data in external offices, and relies solely on data shared with us by Google. Because of this, there will be no transference of your personal data by us.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <h6>Business Transactions</h6>
        <p>If DeliverEd is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your personal data may be transferred. We will provide notice before this occurs.</p>
        <h6>Law Enforcement</h6>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Security of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <p>The security of your personal data is extremely important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
          protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Our collection of data largely relies on the security of data stored by Google.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Children's Privacy</h4>
        <p>Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
          with personal data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
        <p>Our service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us, for example submitting comments on Industry day. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
          review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our app and website, prior to the change
          becoming effective and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this
          page.</p>
